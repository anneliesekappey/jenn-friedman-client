          SYNOPSIS Veganism and eating disorders are often associated with one
          another in the eating disorder field, leading to the widely adopted
          belief that following the dietary component of veganism may inhibit
          recovery from an eating disorder. Friedman posits that this belief is
          founded on an oversimplified view and counters it by exploring the
          ethical dimensions of veganism. She looks at ideas perpetuated around
          veganism and recovery, including the potential harm to vegans
          prohibited from following veganism in treatment centers. Veganism and
          Eating Disorder Recovery culminates in a prospective proposal for a
          "vegan-informed" eating disorder recovery model, which may be adapted
          for clientsâ€™ individual needs. Friedman lays a foundation for an
          improved discourse on veganism and eating disorders by drawing from a
          wide range of resources, including academic research, blog posts,
          eating disorder literature, and anecdotes. This accessible text will
          appeal to professionals and eating disorder clients alike, enabling
          them to collaborate under optimal conditions.
