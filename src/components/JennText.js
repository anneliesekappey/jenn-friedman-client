        Eating Disorders and Veganism: A Deeper Consideration
      </h3>
      <PageTextbox>
        <p>
          Veganism and eating disorders are often associated with one another in
          the eating disorder field. It is widely believed that following the
          dietary component of veganism may inhibit recovery from an eating
          disorder and that veganism, for an eating disordered person, is a form
          of restriction. Relatedly, many eating disorder treatment centers do
          not offer vegan meal plans, posing unique challenges to vegans in need
          of treatment. Since both eating disorders and veganism are on the
          rise, it is essential that we broaden the conversation around this
          topic.
